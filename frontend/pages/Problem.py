        Electricity markets are highly volatile due to:
        - Fluctuations in supply and demand
        - Weather conditions and renewable energy integration
        - Policy, regulations, and market behavior

        This volatility makes **predicting electricity prices** a challenging task.
        Accurate forecasts are crucial for:
        - Energy companies optimizing operations
        - Traders managing risk
        - Consumers benefiting from better pricing

        To tackle the problem, we can apply **data-driven predictive models**:

        - **Machine Learning** methods such as:
          - Linear Regression
          - Random Forests
          - Gradient Boosting

        - **Deep Learning** methods for complex temporal patterns:
          - Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)
          - Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks
          - Transformers for time-series forecasting

        These models learn from **historical electricity price data** along with
        external features (weather, demand, generation mix).

        The result â†’ more **accurate and robust forecasts**, enabling smarter
        decision-making in energy markets.
